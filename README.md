# Titanic Dataset Analysis and Prediction

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset. The project explores data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning to predict passenger survival.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insights into passenger demographics, survival rates, and correlations.
- **Model Building**: Implementation of classification algorithms to predict survival, including performance evaluation.
- **Visualization**: Data trends and patterns illustrated using various plots.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kerolsfatouh/titanic-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis or execute the scripts to train models.
